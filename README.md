# 📝 Notes App (Phase 1)

A simple, clean **Notes App** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This is my **Phase 1 version**, focused on local storage and core functionality.  

## 🚀 Features
- ➕ Add and delete notes  
- 🔍 Search notes with text highlighting  
- 📑 Sort notes (by title/date)  
- 💾 Persistent storage using `localStorage`  
- 🔒 Safe rendering with HTML escaping (prevents XSS)  


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Storage:** Browser `localStorage`  

## 📖 What I Learned
- DOM manipulation (events, rendering updates)  
- LocalStorage for client-side persistence  
- Why escaping HTML matters for security  
- Writing cleaner and modular JavaScript  

## 🎯 Roadmap (Next Phases)
- Phase 2 → Add MVC structure + Rich Text Editor  
- Phase 3 → Full-stack version (DB + authentication + cloud sync)
